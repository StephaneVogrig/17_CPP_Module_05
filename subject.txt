Make a class Bureaucrat.
A Bureaucrat must have:
•A constant name.
•And a grade that ranges from 1 (highest possible grade) to 150 (lowest possible
grade).
Any attempt to instantiate a Bureaucrat using an invalid grade must throw an ex-
ception:
either a Bureaucrat::GradeTooHighException or a Bureaucrat::GradeTooLowException.
You will provide getters for both these attributes: getName() and getGrade(). Implement also two member functions to increment or decrement the bureaucrat grade. If
the grade is out of range, both of them will throw the same exceptions as the constructor.
You will implement an overload of the insertion («) operator to print something like
(without the angle brackets):
<name>, bureaucrat grade <grade>.
